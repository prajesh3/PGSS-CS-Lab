7.12.22 Notes

what do we know/what have we learned so far?
  set up dev environment (local, colab, rstudio, vscode, github)
    R, Python
      scripting, markdowns, notebooks

knowledge areas
  tabular data analysis
    eda: summaries, plots, etc (exploratory data analysis)
    linear regression
    linear classification
  performance analysis
    roc, auc, confusionmatrices, etc
  basic stats 
    distributions
      parametric assumptions for normal dist.
  statistical testing
    differences between groups - t test
  NLP - natural language processiing
    transformers - numreical representation for text
    tokens for analysis
    analyzing data in the context of classification
  knowledge distillation
    
    
whats new for today and ahead?
  knowledge areas
    image analysis
    1D signal analysis
    unsupervised eda
      dimensionality reduction
      projection
    synthetic data generation
    
  development environment skills
    telling data stories
      web apps
      save and load models for web api/app deployment
    what is containerization 
      ci/cd
      IAAS
    low code/no code
      eda 
      model building
    libs
      h2o
      pycaret
      streamlit
      docker

take several obsevers opinions to account for inter observer variability

plot types 
  scatter plot - explore data
  linear - display the linear quality of data
  
  
sdv lib
  gaussiancopula to describe joint distribution of several variables (parametric curves) - use for exptrapolations 
    does make some parametric assumptions but till works for estimations
    
based on these data analyses, you can use human analysis to figure out your solution/answer to your question about that data

many libraries exist to do graphic data analysis (dtale, pandas profiling, sweetviz, autoviz)

crowd source data for color guessing

mindsDB - nocode/lowcode platform
  can connect to dbs or import files from local
  sql to edit database
  
h2o is a library that does low/no code stuff directly in notebook
openjdk is needed for h2o, as it is a python thing with java background that is necessary for h2o to run
vs code is needed for local running
  essentially, after setup, there is an interactive environment (localhost:54321 in search bar) that allows for easy analysis
