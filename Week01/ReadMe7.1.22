L2 7.1.22 Notes

data set for today - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/menonpg/CMU_PGSS_2021/main/Week01/L2-762021/britishSeatBeltStudy.csv

vscode (visual studio code) download to have a local ide
- syntax highlighted
- open local files

linux commands for terminal
cd - change directory
wget - downlaod from the link

miniconda 
anaconda
- both packages (can install) to do extra stuff
- can create environments with all stuff for one project (can install stuff etc just to a certain environment in order to keep stuff together)
conda cheat sheet - https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf

can get to jupyter lab though anaconda

used python to explore seatbelt data set above
- see the relations between data using scatter and box plots
- good for ml type things with models and tuning those models to see relations in data (sklearn type things)

used r to explore seatbelt data set above
- r is often better to do the variable relations determinations

confusion matrix: https://www.google.com/search?q=recall+precision&rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS1012US1012&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5-7zFxtj4AhX1JjQIHYniCYcQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=2560&bih=1272&dpr=1.5#imgrc=nYqOGlaevKD4rM

classification vs regression

classification:
- logistic regression
- categorical response

regression:
- linear regression
- continuous response

summary
- review colab and rstudio cloud
- used seabelt data set
- understand differences between categorical and continuous response variables: linear regression vs classification (logistic regression) in r and python
- difference btwn quantitative and qualitative analyses and meaning of statistical testing with hypotheses (H0 is null hyp, H1 is alternate hyp)
- analysis of classification model results using a confusion matrix, roc anaysis and using sk learn classification reporting techniques
- using box plots to evaluate the optimal operating threshold of a model

made some cool graphs with sklearn
sklearn has a ton of data analysis type stuff beyond the two we used in lab today
all these models can help analyze data

just abt everything can be done in r and python
