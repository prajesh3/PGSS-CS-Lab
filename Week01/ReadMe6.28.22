first notebook in colab
  used python to read a file
  used this dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

R
  dtale for graphical analysis: https://pypi.org/project/dtale/
  
often, python is less open to people who are trying out stuff since it requires prior knowledge or patience to learn the commands, etc.
  R's interactive environment is easier to understand and navigate, often used for stats and analysis by people who are more focused on data
