7.22.22 Notes L8

using github copilot in vscode to create data analysis models
  use a github education account to get access to pro github and copilot

copilot can have errors, etc but if you know your goal and what you are doing with the code, you can strategically use copilot to quickly write code for your goal

fast api - able to access the model from various sources rather than just straight source code

input > 3rd party web app (which calls the api service for insight) > output algo/data/etc
put a meter on it to make money and have a smart contract to protect your intellectual property
