text dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
- hard to use since there is so much that could be going on: words, punctuation, special characters, metaphors and fig lang, etc. 
- can do varios tasks: 
  - matching (ex. job to resume like indeed)
  - ranks (ex. which of the matches are best)
  - retrieval (ex. diplaying/getting certain data points)
  - clasification (ex. political party, sentiment)
  - regression (ex by age)
  matching, ranking, retrieval usually work together
  use libraries with all these different things
  
transformers turn language into a coordinate system as described below (often 768 dimensions)
  this can be used to relate various texts that can be matched, etc with dist formula
  this is done through neural nets
any point in space can be defined by the eigan vectors that define the space
to find the magnitude of the distance between two points in space, use distance formula

often, there are 768 dimensions that can be then reduced to 3, through dimensionality reduction

standardize text using cleantext and cleaning the text
