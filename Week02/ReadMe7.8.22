text dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
- hard to use since there is so much that could be going on: words, punctuation, special characters, metaphors and fig lang, etc. 
- can do varios tasks: 
  - matching (ex. job to resume like indeed)
  - ranks (ex. which of the matches are best)
  - retrieval (ex. diplaying/getting certain data points)
  - clasification (ex. political party, sentiment)
  - regression (ex by age)
  matching, ranking, retrieval usually work together
  use libraries with all these different things
  
transformers turn language into a coordinate system as described below (often 768 dimensions)
  this can be used to relate various texts that can be matched, etc with dist formula
  this is done through neural nets
any point in space can be defined by the eigan vectors that define the space
to find the magnitude of the distance between two points in space, use distance formula

often, there are 768 dimensions that can be then reduced to 3, through dimensionality reduction

standardize text using cleantext and cleaning the text

distilbert - distilled version of bert 
  knowledge transfer - knowledge distillation was used to make it

neural nets 
  weights: don't set the weight suddely to a  number, often you start with a weight and a multiplier and adjust them as the model is trained

process
  cleanse: text --> remove: special chars, punctuation, html; correct: case; fix stuff --> clean text
  split data to train and test
  train model and characterize it
    text --> standard length numeric representation (embedding to model) was made by transformer
  save model
  load model and make a prediction on new data
  
can configure local vs to github: https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/configure-your-dvcs-username-for-commits/

finding outliers
  for removing outliers, the IQR of a boxpolt*1.5 is the +/- on mean for tolerance (typically)
